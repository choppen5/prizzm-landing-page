        <strong>Private by default is our policy.</strong>
        Data in Prizzm is owned by you. In using Prizzm you store your preferences, likes, things you may want to buy.
        Prizzm is for stating your intentions and preferences, whatever they may be at the moment.
      </p>

      <p>
        This data will never be resold, licensed, or broadcast to another party without your explicity permission.
        You own the data, you can edit and revise it at any time, as well as download and delete your data.
        It is anonymous by default.

        When you create a Prizzm profile, you grant license to Prizzm to display content,
        including advertisements and offers to you based on your stated preferences -
        if you actively choose to look at the content.
        The license you grant is transactional: you allow a program such as Prizzm.com
        or a web partner who implements the Prizzm API, to disaply content at the time you ask for it,
        but your Prizzm data will never be used to give you an advertisement at a time that you donâ€™t
        ask for it (such as email spam, junkmail, or selling data to partners for non transactional use).
